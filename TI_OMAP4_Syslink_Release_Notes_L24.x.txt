OMAP4 Syslink List Handoff
================================================================================

Author		: Ramesh Gupta G / Suman Anna
Date		: June 30 2009

===========
Summary:
===========
OMAP4 Syslink consists of required set of drivers for Multi Core
communication. The communication is mainly divided into Chiron to Tesla and
Chiron to Ducati processors. Below sections provide details on the components
in detail.

=================
Tesla MPU Bridge
=================
Tesla MPU bridge is the communication driver between the Chiron and
Tesla processor.

=============
Syslink IPC
=============
Syslink IPC is the communication driver between the Chiron and Ducati cores.

==============
Proc manager
==============
	- Implemented initial version of Proc module. Proc module controls Ducati
	Processors and supports IPC mechanism. Ducati enabler is now part of Proc
	module.
	- DMM support for Ducati memory.

===============
Notify module
===============
	Notify module provides an abstraction to underlying communiation layer,
	notify clients(e.g notify_tesladriver & notify_ducatidriver) would register
	with notify driver(omap_notify) with the supported set of functions
	and the notify users (syslink ipc, tesla bridgedriver) use
	notify driver to use client functionalities.

=============
Sources:
=============
All the above module sources are available along with the
linux-omap4 kernel sources hosted in

http://dev.omapzoom.org/?p=integration/kernel-omap4.git;a=summary

========================================
Building Tesla images and Ducati samples
========================================
	1. Install the CCS and get the CGtools for Tesla and ARM (for Ducati)
	2. Upgrade the BIOS to the latest from T.I website
	3. https://www-a.ti.com/downloads/sds_support/targetcontent/index.html
	4. Follow the DSP Application guide to build DSP samples.
	5. Framework components present in the tarball that is uploaded and also
		on TI website where BIOS is found.
	6. Contact TI representative for Tesla/Ducati images.


=======================
Running Tesla Samples
=======================

	1. Boot the kernel with Ramdisk consisting all the drivers and Tesla
		images, samples, API libraries.

	2. Once kernel is booted, cd into the folder where all the binaries are
		placed.

	3. install all the drivers in the sequence as below, this step is
		required only if the drivers are build as modules,
		if all the drivers are build as part of the kernel one can
		ignore steps 3 and 4

		insmod omap_notify.ko

		insmod notify_disp.ko

		insmod notify_tesladriver.ko

		insmod dspbridge.ko

		insmod bridgedriver.ko

	4. Create device node for bridgedriver accordingly
		by checking the /proc/devices.

		e.g: mknod /dev/DspBridge c 253 0

	5.Load the image using cexec.out

		./cexec.out ddspbase_tiomap4430.dof64T

	6. This loads image and waits the sync mask to be cleared by DSP.
		DSP Start address is displayed  as below.

	- - - DSP Start Address [0x2104b000]- - -


	7. Copy the above start address (0x2104b000), Go to Virtio IDE and break
		the system by typing 'y' in the virtio console.

	8. Open the Code Composer Studio, select Open Tesla.

	9. Open the register window and modify the PC with the DSP Start
		address (0x2104b000).

	10. In CCS hit F11 key for several times (at least 5-10 times) and then
		press F5.

	11. Go back to Teraterm where cexec completes and DSP is started. Now we
		are ready to run dsp samples, below are the commands for running
		samples.

		./scale.out 10
		./zerocopymsg.out
		./strmcopy.out 0 install_bridge out-strm-file.
		./ping.out 10
		./dmmcopy.out inoustall_bridge out-dmm-file


Running Bridge Samples in Dynamic loading mode:

	1. Boot Virtio

	2. Install all the 3 driver using the script as mentioned in above section.
		This step is not required if all the drivers are build as part of the
		kernel.

	3. load dynbase image.
		./cexec.out dynbase_tiomap4430.dof64T

	4. Follow same procedure as above in Section to start DSP. With CCS

	5. Register the required dll as below.
		./dynreg.out -r strmcopydyn_4430.dll64T

	6. Run the strmcopy sample.
		./strmcopy.out 0 install_bridge out-strm

================================================================================
Important Note3: Due to some limitations we cannot run 2 different samples at
one time in dynamic loading mode. One needs to reboot Virtio for running other
sample.
================================================================================

=======================
Running Syslink Samples
=======================

	1. Boot the kernel with ramdisk consisting all the drivers and Syslink
		samples, API libraries. Ducati images need not be part of the ramdisk.

	2. Once kernel is booted, cd into the folder where all the binaries are
		placed.

	3. install all the drivers in the sequence as below, this step is
		required only if the drivers are build as modules,
		if all the drivers are build as part of the kernel one can
		ignore steps 3 and 4

		insmod omap_notify.ko

		insmod notify_disp.ko

		insmod notify_ducatidriver.ko

		insmod syslink_proc.ko

		insmod syslink_proc4430.ko

		insmod syslink_ipc.ko

	4. Create device node for syslink components accordingly
		by checking the /proc/devices.

		mknod /dev/ipcnotify c 232 0

		mknod /dev/notifyducatidrv c 234 0

		mkdir /dev/syslinkipc

		mknod /dev/syslinkipc/ProcMgr c 254 0

		mknod /dev/syslink-proc4430 c 253 0

		mknod /dev/syslink_ipc c 252 0

	5. Configure the Proc module by running the following command. This
		sets up the drivers for running the syslink samples.

		insmod procmgr_app.ko

	6. Run the samples by running the corresponding .out files

		eg: ./messagequ.out

	7. Load the Ducati baseimage when prompted using CCS.


==============================
Validating the Ducati Driver
==============================

One can validate the Ducati enabler driver by running below steps.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Important Note4: CCS need to be configured for "VPOMAP 4 Platform Simulator"

Remove the IVAHD-iCONT1, IVAHD-iCONT2, and Modena.

The System Configuration must have only Tesla and Duati-ARM-M3-1, Ducati-ARM-M3-2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two baseimages Bios6Boot.xem3 and Bios6Boot_Core1.xem3 can be used to validate
the BIOS6 boot validation on each of the cores respectively.

Please contact TI representative for these images.

The following steps detail the boot on Core0. Similar procedure can be followed
to boot the Core1 as well.

	1. Boot the Virtio as usual.

	2. Break the platform by typing 'y' in the Virtio Console after the bash
		shell prompt appears.

	3. install all the drivers in the sequence as below, this step is
		required only if the drivers are build as modules,
		if all the drivers are build as part of the kernel one can
		ignore this step

		insmod omap_notify.ko

		insmod notify_disp.ko

		insmod syslink_proc4430.ko

		insmod notify_ducatidriver.ko

	4. The syslink_proc4430 driver programs MMU and
		updates page table entries.
	5. Break the Virtio by typing y in console.

	6. Open CCS and select Ducati core.

	7. Load the base image into Ducati core0.

	8. In Virtio design , browse to
		VPOM4430->SDP->OMAP4430-> InitValue_DUCATI_SYS_1.
		Right click and open.
		Right click on Signal (InitValue) and select
		Send Signal To Platform.
		Send 1 and press OK. This resets the core.

	9. Press F11 once to have the Reset release become effective.
		Note that the PC does not change here and the SP is updated.
		Press F11 couple more times to make sure Ducati is executing
		and thereafter you can press F5.

Running Notify ping sample on Ducati:
-------------------------------------
	1. Boot Vartio as usual.
	2. Follow the same steps as above install required drivers (step 3
		above), this step is required only if the drivers
		are build as modules, if all the drivers are build
		as part of the kernel one can ignore this step
	3. create nodes for ipcnotify and notifyducatidrv accordinngly.
		e.g: mknod /dev/ipcnotify c 232 0
		     mknod /dev/notifyducatidrv c 234 0
	4. run notifyping.out sample.

	5. The sample keeps in a loop while sending events and
		checking for ducati side initialization.

	6. Break the Virtio by typing y in console.

	7. Open CCS and select Ducati-ARM-M3-1  core.

	6. Load  ducati image (notifyxfer_bios6.xem3) image.

	7. Open source file notifyxfer_bios6.c file and add some breakpoints
		in the main function.

	8. Press F11 once to have the Reset release become effective.
		Note that the PC does not change here and the SP is updated.
		Press F11 couple more times to make sure Ducati is executing
		and thereafter you can press F5.
	9. One can observe Ducati receiving the events from Chiron
		calling the call back function and sending event back to Chiron.

	10. The Notifyping sample running on the Chiron shows event messages
	and call back function messages.

Loading ducati images using the userspace loader:
------------------------------------------------
	1. On successful ducati sample build user space binary loader
		ducati_load.out is build underi folder
		syslink/samples/samples/procmgr/ducati_load/
	2. One can load the ducati image on to SYSM3 or APPM3 using the
		userspace binary loader as below.
			./ducati_load.out <image_name>
	3. on successful load the loader displays the entry point for
		the image at the end.

	------snip----
		loaded_program: 0xea19
		Completed Loading Image ..... notifyxfer_bios6.xem3
		entry_point is 0xea19
		Hit any key to terminate cexec.
	--------------
	4. Due to Virtio issues we cannot start SYSM3/APPM3 from the
		MPU side, one has to use CCS for SYSM3/APPM3 start by
		following below step.
	5. Break Virtio and open CCS, Select the processor on which
		image is loaded.
	6. Open the PC registers.
	7. Set the PC value to the entry point displayed from the loading
		step.
	8. Run couple of times step run.
	9. Run the Processor.

loading images on both SYSM3/APPM3 processors
---------------------------------------------

Follow below procedure to load images on both SYSM3/APPM3 using
user space loader

	1. SYSM3 should be reached main() before loading the APPM3 image.
	2. SYSM3 should be in running state to load APPM3 from MPU using
		user space loader. Otherwise MPU will not respond.
	3. Because of the above reasons, one need to introduce a continuos
		while loop in both the SYSM3/APPM3 programs immediately in the main()
		function at the first place. e.g:

		while(flag)
			;
	4. Load the SYSM3 image using the loader, set the PC using CCS and tun the
		SYSM3 processor. Now SYSM3 executing the while(flag) loop.
	5. Load the APPM3 using the loader, set the PC using the CCS and run the
		APPM3 processor, now the APPM3 is executing the while(flag) loop.
	6. Stop APPM3 processor.
	7. Stop SYSM3 processor.
	8. Bring SYSM3 out of while loop by changing the variable flag to 0 on the
		fly.
	9. Bring APP3 out of while loop by changing the variable flag to 0 on the
		fly.
	10. Run SYSM3 and Run APPM3.
