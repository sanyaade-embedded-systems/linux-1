1.  Introduction
----------------
This document accompanies OMAP(TM) Software Release L24.0.11 for Linux 2.6.31
on OMAP4430 VPOM4430_1.09a_Patch17. The document specifies:
	- Instructions for unpacking the release
	- New features and features the release supports
	- Planned future features
	- Postponed features


2. Release Summary
------------------
This is a Linux Baseport Release for SDP4430 on Virtio.
The kernel is based on Linux-omap version 2.6.31 -rc5 from open source.
U-boot is based on open-source version 1.1.4.

The u-boot source can be obtained via GIT from:
  http://git.omapzoom.org/?p=repo/u-boot.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/omap4_dev

The kernel source can be obtained via GIT from:
  http://dev.omapzoom.org/?p=integration/kernel-omap4.git;a=summary
	L24.0.11 branch
Virtio version used: VPOM4430_1.09a + VPOM4430_1.09a_Patch17.var

All drivers planned for this release are working as expected and
overall platform stability is good.

current L24.0.10 support:
	SMP OS Kernel boot-up on with UART, GPTimers, McBSP, McSPI, I2c,
	GPIO, WATCHDOG, Keypad, Phoenix PM IC, RTC, ALSA AUDIO.

3.  Instructions
----------------

3.1 Virtio Setup

This release works on VPOM4430_1.09a_Patch17.


3.2 Virtio Installation Instructions

a. Install to C:\Virtio
b. Once installation for virtio is started, you will be prompted for
   installation
   for virtual serial port. Say yes to it and give a port number (say 5 or 6).
   Multiple serial ports can also be installed.
c. Install C:\Virtio\Shared\Disassembler\Setup\VirtioDisassembler.exe.
   This is to enable debugging using virtio.
d. License for virtio has to be set in the environment variables
   LM_LICENSE_FILE.
e. Install VPOM4430_1.09a_Patch17.


3.3 Virtio Configuration Instructions

Run virtio and if modify the following parameters

a. On some versions SSM is generating error due to illegal instruction fetch.
   To workaround this you can disable SsmDisableSecurity user parameter.
   Params->User Parameters-> SsmDisableSecurity = yes
   Right click on SsmDisableSecurity parameter and change properties to editable
   mode. Then you can set this parameter to Yes. Default value is no.
b. If IVAHD is enabled the image boot up takes lot of time. If IVAHD component
   is not required it can be disabled.
   Browse to VPOM4430::SDP::OMAP4430::TIOMAP4CORES and disable all the enabled
   components under it
c. Open the Params tab and look at the User Parameters. Set the UARTx_COM_PORT
   to the virtual port number you had provided while installation.
d. Both CPU cores support has been enabled.
e. L2 Cache is not enabled in software. This requires the cache to be turned
   off in the Virtio parameter list too. For this browse to
   VPOM4430::SDP::OMAP4430::CPU_SS::Cortex_1 and set the CacheDisabled parameter
   to true. Browse to VPOM4430::SDP::OMAP4430::CPU_SS::Cortex_2 and set the
   CacheDisabled parameter to true.Also browse to
   VPOM4430::SDP::OMAP4430::CPU_SS::pl310_cache and set the CacheDisabled
   parameter to true.
f. Once booted with two CPU, you can see two penguins on LCD instead on one.
   Linux kernel shows one penguin per CPU.

3.4 Compiling U-Boot

Set the environment variable PATH such that cross compile binaries point to the
needed tool chain. Refer to section 5 for tool chain information.

To select the default configuration for U-Boot type:
	# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- omap4430sdp_config

To build the U-Boot image type:
	# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

3.5 Compiling X-Loader

Not yet supported

3.6 Compiling the Kernel

Set the environment variable PATH such that cross-compile binaries point to the
needed tool chain. Refer to section 5 for tool chain information.

The default configuration file for Virtio4430 is present at
arch/arm/configs/omap_4430sdp_defconfig.

To work with the default configuration file, run following commands:
	# make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-
					omap_4430sdp_defconfig

Build kernel with:
	# make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- uImage

NOTE:	The above steps will create arch/arm/boot/uImage in the kernel directory
	which is the binary used for booting.

Filesystem:
NFS file system is not yet supported. Use ramdisk instead.
The default configuration for ramdisk is in the 4430 defconfig.
	Load address = 0x81600000
	Default size = 20MB


3.7 Running U-Boot boot loader on RAM

Go to the design tab. Open Scripts-> configs/Native Apps/Native Apps.script.
Replace it as shown below.
Then launch HyperTerminal and connect to the virtual serial port installed.
(e.g. COM5).
Now choose Native Apps in the configuration tabs at the top and select run.
The SDP4430 U-Boot prompt will appear in your terminal emulation program.

------------------------- [End of Native Apps.script]---------------------------

3.8 Running Linux kernel

The kernel binary used will be arch/arm/boot/uImage.


3.8.1 Loading the kernel image via Virtio
Note that the new NativeApp.script can load the kernel image & file sytem
image.

Just give below command on u-boot prompt.
	bootm  0x80300000
You should see the kernel booting and ramdisk getting loaded in a few seconds

3.8.2 Loading the kernel image via Trace32

Launch the T32. If console window is already running t32.cmm script is
automatically run and you will be attached to the system. If not you will have
to manually run t32.cmm script file.
Break the system through t32
Use the following commands from T32 window to load up the kernel image and
file system
	Data.load.binary <your Image path>/Image 0x80300000
	Data.load.binary <your ramdisk path> 0x81600000
        r r15=0x80e80054

Select 'go' in the T32 window
Go to the hyper terminal and execute the following

>bootm  0x80300000

You should see the kernel booting and ramdisk getting loaded in a few seconds

NOTE: The kernel binary used is arch/arm/boot/uImage and
      not arch/arm/boot/Image.
