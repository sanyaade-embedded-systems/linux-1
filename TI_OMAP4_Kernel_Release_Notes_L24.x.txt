3.  Instructions
----------------

3.1 Board setup

Please refer to the OMAP4430 SDP guide for instructions on setting up the OMAP4
board.

3.2 Compiling Images

3.2.1 Compiling U-boot

Set the environment variable PATH such that cross compile binaries point to the
needed tool chain. Refer to section 5 for tool chain information.

To select the default configuration for U-Boot type:
	# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- omap4430sdp_config

To build the U-Boot image type:
	# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-


3.2.2 Compiling X-loader (for booting from external/removable MMC)

Set the environment variable PATH such that cross compile binaries point to the
needed tool chain. Refer to section 5 for tool chain information.

U-boot needs to be placed in a directory parallel to x-loader and compiled first.
E.g.:
	[DIR] omap4
		+-- u-boot
		+-- x-loader

To select the default configuration for X-loader type:
	# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- omap4430sdp_config

To build the X-loader image type:
	# make CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-
	# make ift CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-

The above step will create a MLO image, which can be copied into the
MMC card for booting via MMC.

3.2.3 Compiling X-loader (for booting from eMMC)

Follow same steps as above to create an MLO image. A configuration header needs
to be added at the begining of this MLO to create an image 'x-load.ch.bin' that
can be written to the eMMC for eMMC-booting. Please contact your TI
representative for obtaining the configuration header.

3.2.4 Compiling the Kernel

Set the environment variable PATH such that cross-compile binaries point to the
needed tool chain. Refer to section 5 for tool chain information.

The default configuration file for OMAP 4430 is present at
arch/arm/configs/omap_4430sdp_defconfig.

To work with the default configuration file, run following commands:
	# make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi-
					omap_4430sdp_defconfig

Build kernel with:
	# make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-none-linux-gnueabi- uImage

NOTE:	The above steps will create arch/arm/boot/uImage in the kernel directory
	which is the binary used for booting.

3.3 Flashing and Booting

3.3.1 Booting from removable MMC

Use the MLO (ref: section 3.2.2) and u-boot.bin (ref: section 3.2.1) binaries
and follow the instructions at http://elinux.org/BeagleBoard#MMC.2FSD_boot
to boot the board from removable MMC.

Set the board switch settings as follows to boot the board from removable MMC:
	S9 - 1-off, 2-on, 3-on, 4-on
	S8 - 1-off, 2-on, 3-off, 4-on, 5-on, 6-on, 7-on, 8-on

3.3.2 Flashing and booting from eMMC

Follow the instructions below to save x-loader and u-boot binaries to eMMC and
subsequently boot from eMMC.

Get the x-loader and u-boot binaries (that you want to flash to eMMC) into RAM
using one of the following options.

Option 1:
Use a debugger or OMAPFlasher tool to download x-loader (with configuration
header, e.g. x-load.ch.bin) as well as u-boot.bin into
SDRAM and run u-boot from SDRAM.

Option 2:
Boot via a removable MMC card following the instructions in section 3.3.1, but
additionally keep the x-load.ch.bin that you want to flash to eMMC in the same
removable MMC card. After booting from removable MMC, copy the x-load.ch.bin
and u-boot.bin from the MMC to RAM using the following commands:
OMAP44XX SDP # mmcinit 0
OMAP44XX SDP # fatload mmc 0 [Ram Address X] x-load.ch.bin
OMAP44XX SDP # fatload mmc 0 [Ram Address Y] u-boot.bin

Once the x-loader and u-boot binaries are in RAM, use the following commands
to copy them to eMMC.

1) Erase all EMMC contents
OMAP44XX SDP # mmcinit 1
OMAP44XX SDP # mmc 1 erase 0x0 0x800000
2) Flash x-loader
OMAP44XX SDP # mmc 1 erase  0x100  [size of x-loader in hex]
OMAP44XX SDP # mmc 1 write [Ram Address X]  0x100  [size of x-loader in hex]
Note: Ram address X is address where x-loader is downloaded in RAM using either the
debugger, OMAPFlasher or removable MMC.
3) Flash u-boot.bin
OMAP44XX SDP # mmc 1 erase  0x400  [size]
OMAP44XX SDP # mmc  1 write  [Ram Address Y]  0x400  [size]
Note: Ram address Y is address where u-boot is downloaded in RAM using either the
debugger, OMAPFlasher or removable MMC.

Set the board switch settings as follows to boot the board from eMMC:
	S9 - 1-off, 2-on, 3-on, 4-on
	S8 - 1-on, 2-on, 3-on, 4-on, 5-on, 6-off, 7-on, 8-on

3.3.3 Using Filesystem from eMMC

Use fdisk to create an ext2 partition (/dev/mmcblk0p2) in eMMC leaving 2MB of space
at the top.

Use the following commands to flash the filesystem to eMMC partition
1) Bootup with a known good kernel and filesystem from RAM
2) Use a filesystem which has USB Gadget filestorage module g_filestorage.ko
3) Connect the usb cable from the board to the PC
4) Load the USB filestorage gadget module as:
insmod g_filestorage.ko file=/dev/mmcblk0p2 stall=0 removable=1
5) When the USB drive enumerates on the Linux PC, mount the drive
6) Add ext2 filesystem to the mounted drive
7) sync and then mount the drive.
8) Add the following in bootargs "root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw rootdelay=1" to be able
to use the eMMC based FS as rootfs.

3.3.4 Bootargs

Since UART3 is used as the console on OMAP4 Wakeup board, you need to set
'console=ttyO2,115200n8' in the bootargs

While using a filesystem from MMC or eMMC, you may use params such as:
'root=/dev/mmcblk1p2 rw rootdelay=1'. The rootdelay is required because
removable cards may take a few seconds to be detected.

Also note that 'root=/dev/mmcblkXp2' where "x" means 1 or 2 depending if you
use MMC as default this should be 1 or eMMC should be 0.

While using a filesystem via NFS, you may use params such as:
'root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=&lt;serverip&gt;:&lt;mount-partition&gt;,nolock'

Refer to section 3.4.2 for display related bootargs options

For detailed list and explaination of the various boot parameters, please refer
http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/lkn/lkn_pdf/ch09.pdf


3.4 Using FB and V4L2 Display driver

For details please refer to:
http://omappedia.org/wiki/Bootargs_for_enabling_display

3.5 Enabling Power Management Features

All PM features are disabled in the default OMAP4 kernel configuration
(omap_4430sdp_defconfig).
All clocks are still kept enabled on bootloader.

To test PM features please use omap4_pm_defconfig. Note that PM features
on OMAP4430 ES1.0 can only be verified on a EMU device. The EMU device needs
the x-loader signed with the right PPA release.

omap4_pm_defconfig does not enable Tick suppression. To do so enable these
options manually.

Enable the following options in menuconfig
	Kernel Features ---> Use local timer interrupts
	Kernel Features ---> Tickless System
	Kernel Features ---> High Resolution Timer support

omap4_pm_defconfig has VFP support disabled due to a know issue with enabling
FPU on ES1. Please do not enable VFP support.

3.5.1 CPU Hotplug

To hotplug out CPU1 use the following command

echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online

To bring back CPU1 online use the following command

echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online

Note that CPU0 cannot be offlined due to hardware limitation.
Currenlty CPU1 transitions to CSWR state when offlined. This can
only be verified using OBS signals.

3.5.2 CPUIdle

To test cpuidle, it's necessary that CPU1 is hotplugged out.
Use the below command to hotplug out CPU1
echo 0 >  /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online

Once CPU1 is hotplugged out, OBS signals can be used to
verify MPU/CPU0/CPU1 transtitions.

Currently only sleep state of MPU CSWR is supported.

3.5.3 System Suspend

To test system suspend, use the following command

echo mem > /sys/power/state

Use OBS signals to verify MPU/CPU0/CPU1 transitions.

Currently only sleep state of MPU CSWR is supported.

Please use a ramdisk inorder to test system suspend feature

3.6 Using Audio Driver

Include the asound.conf file in /etc directory in your FS. It maps the different
audio devices 

Usage:
aplay -D mm file.wav
aplay -D tones file.wav
aplay -D vx file.wav
aplay -D hd_audio file.wav

	- Temperature Sensor

4.2 Supported Features

- Boot-loader:
	X-loader with MMC/eMMC/SD support

          permanently to persistent storage device which is currently eMMC on
          OMAP4430SDP and doesn't save on removable MMC.

          The environment variables  are stored on RAW partition of size 1MB on eMMC 
          starting from sector 0x700 to sector 0x7FF.

         Saveenv is restored back and the usage is as below:
         -- Just typing saveenv prompts user to press 'y' or 'Y'  once user confirms 
             env is saved to eMMC or else throws message "Cannot save env to eMMC'
         -- typing "saveenv -f"  doesn't forcefully updates env without user intervention
